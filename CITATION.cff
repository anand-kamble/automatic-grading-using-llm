  This repository contains code and configurations for an automated grading system
  using large language models (LLMs) in an educational context. The project explores
  scalability, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), distributed processing, and synthetic data
  generation techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency in automated grading.
